make sure we:
    -check if free not first byte
    -test with multiple files
    -create mk.test
    -make design doc

To compile, just copy the files into minix and run ./mk.build

If mk.build is not executable use chmod u+x mk.build, and run ./mk.build

To test our program using our test file, run ./testing

To use your own test programs include slugmalloc.h, compile, 
and then run your executable.
